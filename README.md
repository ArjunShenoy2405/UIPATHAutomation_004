Client Security Hash Generation - The objective of this RE Framework project is to calculate encrypted security hashes for different clients. The workflow invokes the activities which collects WI5 data from ACME portal and builds hash strings by combining client data. The hash strings are encrypted to generate security hashes using SHA1 portal. Later the control flows back to ACME system where it comments the security hash & updates the work item accordingly.
